# TBD #

## Heading ##
  > Finding food recommendations through social media.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Anyone can use this simple location based food reccomendations using photos.

## Summary ##
  > Finding good food should be easy. Using our app you can see images of food near you or at a chosen location. You can also see a feed from other users (friends, family, basically anyone) showing what they have eaten lately. It's simple and fast. No need to go risk eating subpar, what you see is what you get.

## Problem ##
  > There is a gap between food reviewing sites and the mobile user. The user experience on the converted to mobile app is clumsy. On other apps, the written reviews are a great resource but the image loading can take quite a bit of time on the mobile. 

## Solution ##
  > Users can follow who they trust for food reccommendations and see a customized live stream of photos. The location tracking allows for us to give relevant images based on distance, time, as well as popularity.

## Quote from You ##

## Customer Quote ##

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Download our app, it's great. For more information check out https://github.com/vivacioussalt/vivacious-salt.
