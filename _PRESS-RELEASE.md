# TBD #

## Heading ##
  > Look at high quality user-taken photos to find good eats anywhere.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Anyone can use this simple location based food reccomendations using photos.

## Summary ##
  > Finding good food should be easy. Using our app you can see images of food near you or at a chosen location. You can also see a feed from other users (friends, family, basically anyone) showing what they have eaten lately. It's simple and fast. No need to go risk eating subpar, what you see is what you get.

## Problem ##
  > There is a gap between food reviewing sites and the mobile user. The user experience on their mobile apps are clumsy. Written reviews are a great resource but the image loading can take quite a bit of time on the mobile. Food is best seen not read about.

## Solution ##
  > Users can follow who they trust for food recommendations and see a customized live stream of photos. You can follow your friends and see their feed. Accurate geo-tagging allow for users to see photos taken at that restaurant. The location tracking allows for us to give relevant images based on distance, time, as well as popularity.
